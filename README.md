# Parker_Model_Solar_Wind
A MATLAB-based model of the Parker solar wind solution with physical unit conversion, density profiles, and comparison to empirical coronal models.

**Solar Wind Model - Parker Equation and Solar Corona Dynamics**\\
This repository contains MATLAB scripts for modeling the solar wind based on the Parker solar wind equation. It includes visualization of isodense contours, selection of physically relevant wind solutions, interpolation, transformation into real physical units (velocity, distance, density), and comparison with empirical solar atmospheric models.

**Code Overview**\\
1. Isodense Contours\\
Plots contours of constant "C" values from the dimensionless Parker solar wind equation:
- Shows the structure of possible solutions in the (Œæ, u) space.
- Marks the critical point where the velocity equals the speed of sound.

2. Solution Choice\\
Extracts and filters the physically valid solution for a chosen isodense value (C = -3), selecting points that start subsonic and end supersonic.

3. Interpolation\\
Interpolates the selected Parker wind solution using linear interpolation to create a smooth solar wind velocity profile in normalized units.

4. Velocity and Distance (Physical Units)
- Converts the normalized Parker wind solution into physical units (km/s and solar radii).
- Plots solar wind speed for various coronal temperatures.
- Overlays Earth‚Äôs orbit for context.

5. Density vs Distance
- Calculates and plots the solar wind plasma density in cm‚Åª¬≥ as a function of distance.
- Uses the mass conservation law and outputs results for multiple coronal temperatures.
- Logarithmic scale captures the density drop-off.

6. Save Density and Frequency Profiles
- Saves the density and plasma frequency (Hz) at selected heliocentric distances (in solar radii) to .txt files. Useful for radio burst and solar wind diagnostics.

7. Atmospheric Models\\
Implements widely used empirical models: Newkirk, Saito, Leblanc, and Vr≈°nak. Compares their predicted plasma densities across heliocentric distances.
